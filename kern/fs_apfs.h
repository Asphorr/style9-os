/*
 * Read-only APFS -- the filesystem a Darwin personality ought to be reading.
 *
 * Everything else on this rung is already Apple-shaped (Mach-O images, a
 * clean-room dyld, libSystem, launchd, Mach IPC), and FAT was only ever the
 * placeholder that let a binary find a data file at all.  APFS is the real
 * thing, and unlike the rest of the Apple surface here it does not have to be
 * reverse engineered: Apple published the on-disk format.
 *
 * Three ideas carry the whole format, and the code below is organised around
 * them:
 *
 *	1. EVERY metadata block starts with an obj_phys header carrying a
 *	   Fletcher-64 checksum of the rest of the block, plus the object's id
 *	   (oid) and the transaction that wrote it (xid).  Nothing is trusted
 *	   without checking that checksum -- a half-written block is exactly
 *	   what a copy-on-write filesystem expects to find after a crash.
 *
 *	2. There is no single fixed superblock.  Block 0 is only an anchor;
 *	   the live container superblock is whichever copy in the CHECKPOINT
 *	   DESCRIPTOR ring carries the highest xid and still checksums.  That
 *	   ring is how APFS commits atomically: write the new state elsewhere,
 *	   then land one new superblock.  Mounting means finding the newest
 *	   valid one, which is what makes an interrupted write a no-op rather
 *	   than corruption.
 *
 *	3. Objects are addressed indirectly.  A PHYSICAL oid is a block
 *	   number, but a VIRTUAL oid has to be translated through an object
 *	   map (omap) B-tree first, because copy-on-write moves objects
 *	   without changing their identity.
 *
 * This rung implements (1) and (2): probe the container, verify it, and find
 * the live superblock.  Volume and file access build on top.
